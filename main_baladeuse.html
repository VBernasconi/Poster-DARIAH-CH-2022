        The use of computational methods within the field of art history is usually
        restricted to digitization and archiving tools, or more complex computational
        methods for statistical analysis of corpuses and patterns detection. With
        the project <em>La main baladeuse</em>, the potential of the artistic exploration
        is further considered. Built for the online exhibition <em>Visual Contagions</em> of
        the Jeu de Paume Museum, La main baladeuse offers to users a direct interaction
        with past painted and drawn hands gathered from the internet. The artwork further
        develop the concept of embodied knowledge and allows user to consider their own
        gestures as a constitutive part of an artwork shaped by many time and cultural dimensions.
        The contemporary hand is placed at the center of the composition, offering the
        perspective of an heritage of hand poses and directly question the sense of personnal
        gestural expressions in relation to our visual culture.
