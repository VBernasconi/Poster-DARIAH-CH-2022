      <h1><strong>Gestures for Artwork Browsing (GAB) application</strong></h1>
      <div class="description">
        At an early stage in the project came the need to search for specific items
        within the collection of hands. However, traditional browsing tools usually
        require a word input, which implies annotations of images, called metadata,
        and some knowledge of the content of the collection. Through a series
        of discussions with the DVS group, the idea of a browsing tool through gestures
        is born. The benefits from this approach are multiple, from which: the implication of the
        user's personnal gestural knowledge, the possibility to put past gestures
        in a contemporary perspective, and the possibility to make discoveries
        through unexpected gestures.
