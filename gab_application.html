      <h1><strong>Gestures for Artwork Browsing (GAB) application</strong></h1>
      <div class="description">
        At an early stage in the project came the need to search for specific items
        within the collection of hands. However, traditional browsing tools usually
        require a word input, which implies annotations of images, such as a description
        and the metadata holding the title, author and year of creation,
        and some knowledge of the content of the collection. Through a series
        of discussions with the DVS group, the idea of a browsing tool through gestures
        is born. The benefits from this approach are multiple, from which: the implication of the
        user's personnal gestural knowledge, the possibility to put past gestures
        in a contemporary perspective, and to make discoveries through unexpected gestures.
        </br>
        With this approach, the understanding of what is present or not within the
        collection, as well as the very first perception of an artwork, is done through
        the detail of the hand. In an environment where the physical hand becomes the
        only access to the artworks, the question of embodied knowledge is raised, as
        well as the possibility for the art historian to "strike the pose" and gain
        a deeper understanding of the implications of the model in the depiction
        of gesutres.
