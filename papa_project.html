    The Pose Annotations Project for Artworks (PAPA) project
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    As you may have seen from the index finger, the accuracy of machine learning
    models, when applied to artworks, is significantly lower. Indeed, most models
    are trained on real images, datasets of pictures gathered from the internet
    and which depict our modern western way of life. These representations are far
    from the pictorial realism of the Early Modern Time, which explains the difficulties
    of the machine when confronted to these new images. One of the many solutions
    to increase the accuracy of the results is to create a proper training dataset
    for artworks. However, the process is usually long and requires the help of
    annotators to mark each image with keypoints for the task of body pose estimation.
    The PAPA project aims to build such a dataset with the help of pationate people
    and propose an online platform where the photographic collection of the Bibliotheca
    Hertziana can be annotated in order to retrain the model primarily used to detect
    body poses.
