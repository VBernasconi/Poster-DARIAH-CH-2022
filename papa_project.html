      <div class="description mb-5 pb-5">
        As you may have noticed from the use of openpose on a painting, the accuracy of machine learning
        models, when applied to artworks, is significantly lower. Indeed, most models
        are trained on real images, datasets of pictures gathered from the internet
        and which depict our modern western way of life. These representations are far
        from the pictorial realism of the Early Modern Time, which explains the difficulties
        of the machine when confronted to these new images. One of the many solutions
        to increase the accuracy of the results is to create a proper training dataset
        for artworks. However, the process is usually long and requires the help of
        annotators to mark each image with keypoints for the task of body pose estimation.
        The PAPA project aims to build such a dataset with the help of pationate people
        and propose an online platform where the photographic collection of the Bibliotheca
        Hertziana can be annotated in order to retrain the model primarily used to detect
        body poses.
