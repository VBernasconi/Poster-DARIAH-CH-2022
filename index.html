      <h1>Augmenting art history: a new story of the painted hand</h1>
      <div class="description">
        The use of computational methods within the field of art history is usually
        restricted to digitization and archiving tools, allowing the preservation of
        digital collections and their online access to the world. However, over the
        past decade, many projects have shown the possibility to use computer vision
        and machine learning methods to automate tasks on large corpuses of paintings
        and to better outline recurrent patterns. Unfortunately, these works are often
        overlooked by art historians who have limited access to these complex computational
        methods and might sometimes perceive them as an intrusion of the scientific
        methodology to their field.

        The aim of the present project is to showcase what computer science has to
        offer beyond automated data processing and to propose tracks towards new
        methodoloical approaches, allowing new perceptions of artworks and artistic
        practice.

        Through a research project on computational and historical analysis of hands
        and gestures in early modern time, where different technologies are used to
        better grasp the many dimensions of the painted hand, the idea of the machine
        as a new agent in the relationship between paintings and art historians is
        envisioned. This exploration has many facets, one of which is the creation of
        an interactive tool to facilitate research on a large corpus of painted hands,
        directly using the hand gesture of the user as a query. Fostering a new
        understanding of painted hand gestures through computer vision, animations
        and enactment, the goal is to propose, through the eye of the machine, a new
        way of seeing.
