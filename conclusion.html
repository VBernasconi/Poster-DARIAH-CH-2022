        The goal of the present poster is to show the audience the possibility to play hand in hand with technologies and
        scientific conventions in order to offer new perceptions on a digital subject. Indeed, we can now project images in new spaces,
        experience artworks out of their original realm and render them in different formats, proposing another digital reality
        to these images that are no longer paintings but a binary representation of their physical object. Similarly to the concept of this poster,
        the project presented follows such a digital scheme. From the enhancement of computer vision and machine learning methods, to the creation of
        new types of browsing tools and artistic explorations, we now have the possibility to envision paintings through the only detail of the hand and to
        reflect on what it means in terms of methodologies and research questions. What we have concretely found so far regarding
        historical analysis of hand gestures in Early Modern time is not about the evolution of specific patterns in time and place, but rather
        about a global perception that we have of them. Hands during Renaissance come in all sorts of shapes and positions because of a need
        to represent more natural gestures. Guided by the machine, we were able to pay closer attention to hand poses we would not have considered
        otherwise and to reflect on their meaning from different contextual levels. Therefore, the idea is not to force the machine into traditional
        art historical methods, but to rather allow researchers to see differently. In conclusion to these first series of experiments, considering new ways
        of perceiving artworks might be key to future digital art history research. Regarding the future of this project on hands in itself, it will be made
        of refinments of very unperfect tools and further reflections on the new dimensions we can give to painted hands.
